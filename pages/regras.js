                One randomly chosen player begins as the Card Czar and plays a Black Card. <br />
       The Card Czar reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the Black Card out loud.<br />
       Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one White Card, face down, to the Card Czar.<br />
       The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers and shares each card combination with the group.<br />
       For full effect, the Card Czar should usually re-read the Black Card before presenting each answer.
